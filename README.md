It lives!

With much Thanks to Lin Clark's workshopper boilerplate, found here: https://github.com/linclark/demo-workshopper

This is a workshop project designed to teach practical usage of functional javascript from a full stack perspective.

It is loosely based on ideas found in Michael Fogus' book, Functional Javascript: Introducing Functional Programming wtih Underscore.js (link: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do ), though we will be using Ramda instead of underscore (see: Underscore, your doing it wrong! http://functionaltalks.org/2013/05/27/brian-lonsdorf-hey-underscore-youre-doing-it-wrong/)

More Details to come.
